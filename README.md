**Title**:

**Predicting House Rental Prices in the United States**

**Introduction**:

1. **Context**:
   This research aims to develop a Machine Learning prediction model to estimate house rental prices throughout the United States based on a variety of factors that define the characteristics of the properties. The dataset incorporates multiple features that encapsulate various aspects of each house, along with the target variable 'Price' that we intend to predict.

2. **Motivation**:
   When considering renting a house, numerous factors such as location, size, number of rooms, and more come into play. The increasing number of housing options can make this decision challenging. This project seeks to assist both landlords in setting appropriate rental rates for their properties and tenants in finding reasonably priced rentals. Additionally, this prediction technique will aid investors in making informed investment decisions to maximize their returns.

3. **Objective**:
   Our goal is to construct a model capable of advising individuals on the fair rental price for a specific property listing in a particular location, accounting for amenities and the prevailing market conditions. We aim to minimize the gap between actual rental prices and predicted rents by employing a variety of machine learning techniques to assess the model's performance.

**Methodology**:

We will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, beginning with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a holistic understanding. Subsequently, we will engage in data cleaning, identifying missing values, numerical variable distributions, and leveraging the Seaborn library for visualizations to detect outliers and categorical variables. A pair plot will be generated to visualize 2D relationships between features, aiding in the selection of the most suitable machine learning model. The potential algorithms to be considered include:
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

**Description**:

The housing price dataset is 380.29 MB in size, comprising 22 columns and 265,192 records. Each record contains a unique house identifier, along with details such as region, type, room count, amenities, pet policies, descriptions, location, and the crucial 'price' attribute.
